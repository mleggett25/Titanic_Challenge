# Titanic Challenge Using Pandas and Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview of the Titanic Challenge

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to create a machine learning model that will predict whether or not a passenger of the Titanic survived based on various factors. This challenge is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Data Dictionary

Kaggle provided a training dataset and a test dataset. The training dataset included the 'Survived' variable and was used to train the machine learning model. The test dataset does not include the 'Survived' variable and was used to test whether or not the model was able to accurately predict whether or not the passenger survived. The predictions are submitted to Kaggle and an accuracy score is given.

## Missing Values
In order to better understand the dataset and clean it as necessary, I first looked to see if the data had any missing values.
